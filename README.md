# UX Design Portfolio: Mobile App Project

Welcome to my UX Design Portfolio repository! This project is the first in a series as part of my UX Design Certificate program. It focuses on designing a mobile app that solves a specific problem for a hypothetical business or organization. Later in the certificate program, I will expand this project into a responsive website using the same prompt.

## 📱 Project Overview

### 🎯 Goal
Design a user-friendly, accessible, and engaging **mobile application** that meets the core needs of a fictional organization and its users.

### 🧠 Hypothetical Business Prompt
*To be updated once finalized.*

Example (placeholder):
> **"LocalRoots"** is a community-based organization that connects users with locally grown produce. They need a mobile app to help users locate, reserve, and pick up fresh produce from nearby farms or farmers' markets.

## 🔍 UX Process

This project follows a human-centered design approach:

1. **Empathize**: User research, interviews, personas
2. **Define**: Problem statement, user needs, and business goals
3. **Ideate**: Sketches, user flows, wireframes
4. **Prototype**: Low- and high-fidelity prototypes using Figma
5. **Test**: Usability testing, feedback integration, iterations

## 📌 Upcoming Phase

This mobile app design will serve as the foundation for a **responsive web version**, which will be developed later in the UX certificate program. The web version will continue to follow UX best practices for layout, responsiveness, and accessibility.
